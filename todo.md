# Todo
- move Centazio.Host to Centazio.Hosts directory and test that it works
- better secrets management
- better cloud settings management (env vars?) - including cron timers
- aws/azure wrappers:
  - Azure:
    - fix Log.Logger, currently only injected ILogger<> works
    - application insights (is this completed?) 
    - function-to-function triggers
  - Aws:
    - function-to-function triggers
- a good integration test that checks:
  - package nuget
  - dotnet tool install (from local nuget)
  - in a non-dev directory
  - centazio gen sln
  - centazio gen func
  - create simple func (that causes a side effect that can be checked)
  - run func using `centazio host`
  - test func worked
  - test func in azure that works
  - test func in aws that works
- cli:
  - simulate should not open a new window when running just one function
  - generators needs a bit of work, comments, etc. Do tutorial
- the readme/tutorial should automatically insert code samples from the real codebase, instead of duplicating it
- snowflake provider
- a good simulation tester, using excel to simulate data flows perhaps?
- remove all ugly usage of auto Dto conversions, remove DtoHelpers, use manual mapping only (settings already done)
- create a good set of architectural policies that can be validated using NetArchTest, see: https://dateo-software.de/blog/netarchtest
  - many tests in `Centazio.Core.Tests.Inspect` namespace can be improved using NetArchTest
