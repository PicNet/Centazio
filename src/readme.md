# Todo
- set up testing pipeline (agent is ready)
- careful testing of date handling

- CLI:

- EntityStager:
  - unit tests:
    - check that results from the 'store' are always returned oldest to newest allowing batching 
    - check the limits of the 'stores' will dynamo with current settings handle 1000 records for instance

- Promote:
  - support full promote (entire list), i.e. delete all and recreate

- Cloud
  - Use Code Generators to generate Lambda/Azure function wrappers

# Developer Guidelines:

## Code Style 
- 2 tab spaces
- Braces on same line
- Avoid long camme-case names.  Methods should be short so having ugly variableNamesThatAddNoValueInAShortContext should
    be avoided. 
- Class names and method names can be descriptive, allowing for short/concise variables
- Use implicitly typed variables where possible
- Use `is null` / `is not null` instead of `== null` / `!= null`

## Logging
- Logging should prefer lower case.  When describing code (classes, etc) then proper casing is allowed
- Test all structured logging and add any 'clean' versions of structured output to `LogInitialiser.cs` also override
    class `ToString()` method where appropriate to support clean structured logging
- Logging of exceptions should use the exception override logging methods: `Log.Information(exception, message)` and
    not passing the exception as an `{@Exception}` parameter
- Consider that logs are written as follows:
  - {"@t":\<timestamp>,"@mt":\<message template>,\<property pairs>}
  - So try to keep the message template clean.  Example:
    - `Log.Information("error occurred {@SystemState} {@LifecycleStage} {@ErrorMessage}")`
    - This has a very brief lowercase message 'error occurred'
    - Then followed by structured objects being specific of their `Class` names
    - Try not to mix messages and objects like `"This @ObjectName is an object inside the message"`

## Exceptions
- Exception messages should be lower case.  When describing code (classes, etc) then proper casing as allowed
- Exception messages should be very concise, example: `already initialised` is better than `class XXX should only be
    initialised once, and it appears that it is already initialsed, bad boy`.  The latter adds no additional value
    only opportunity for typos and clutter
- Any parameters shown in exceptions should be inside square brackets, eg: `throw new Exception(@"value is invalid [{Value}]");`
- Prefer using helpers, such as `ArgumentException.ThrowIf` rather than `if (x is null) throw new ArgumentException`

## Unit Testing
- All complex logic should be unit tested
- Simple logic should not be unit tested, this includes records, simple properties, etc
- Special care is needed when testing date related operations
  - The `TestingUtcDate.DoTick()` method can be used to increment the testing `Now` value to ensure date handling
  is being done correctly
- Extension methods encourage testing of otherwise private methods so use them
- Add unit test project as `[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("<test_project>")]` so that testable code can be marked as 
  internal
